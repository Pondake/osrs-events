# Backlog

Living priority list for the `experiment/laravel-stack` branch. This is not a
changelog — when an item is done, **delete it from this file** rather than
checking it off. `docs/PROGRESS.md` and `docs/ROADMAP.md` are the historical
record of the old NestJS/Nuxt stack; this file is only what's left to do.

Roadmap, in order:

1. ~~Clean up the repo~~ — done (this branch): old stack moved to `stale/`
   (gitignored, kept on disk for reference), Laravel now lives at repo root
   so Herd can park it and serve `osrs-events.test`, docs consolidated here.
2. Migrate everything else to Laravel — see **Migration** below.
3. Expand admin/user management — currently Discord-login-only, see **Admin & users** below.
4. Secure the whole thing — all requests, all future auth routes — see **Security** below.

---

## Housekeeping (before step 2 starts)

- [ ] Rewrite `CLAUDE.md` for the new layout and stack. It still documents
  the NestJS + Nuxt conventions (pnpm workspace paths, GraphQL codegen,
  Prisma) and the old `backend/`/`frontend/` structure — none of it matches
  the repo as it now stands. Left untouched deliberately during the cleanup
  since it's a real rewrite, not a move.
- [ ] Revisit `docs/ROADMAP.md` and `docs/PROGRESS.md` once the repo
  cleanup + migration are far enough along to know what of the old roadmap
  still applies, what's obsolete, and what should fold into this file instead.
- [ ] Decide whether `docs/README.md` should be restored to repo root — moving
  it means GitHub no longer renders a landing readme for the repo.

## Migration (step 2)

Full findings and rationale: see the published prototype report from this
branch's SSR evaluation. Concrete carry-over work:

- [x] ~~Port remaining 11 of 16 Prisma models to Eloquent~~ — done. All 16
  models now have Eloquent equivalents (`BoardAuthor`, `BoardAccess`,
  `BoardInvite`, `UserGuild`, `TeamMember`, `UserPermission`, `UserRole`,
  `Role`, `Task`, `BoardTeam` + the original 5 from the prototype), UUID PKs
  throughout including `users` (settled the UUID-vs-bigint question in
  UUID's favor, so no mixed-key schema). **Not done**: the actual
  `BoardAccessMode` (OPEN/GUILD/INVITE) authorization logic and
  `BoardInvite.use_count` increment-on-join transaction — the tables exist,
  the enforcement code doesn't yet. See Security below.
- [x] ~~Port Discord OAuth + guild sync~~ — done.
  `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/DiscordController.php` via
  `laravel/socialite` + `socialiteproviders/discord`, matching the old
  NestJS `AuthService`/`UsersService` behavior: new users get the PLAYER
  role, guild sync is delete-all-and-reinsert in a transaction and is
  non-fatal on failure. One bug found and fixed while wiring it up:
  Socialite's `->scopes()` *merges* with the driver's default scope list
  instead of replacing it — was silently requesting an unwanted `email`
  scope until switched to `->setScopes()`. Needs real
  `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`/`DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET` in `.env` before the callback
  can be tested end-to-end (redirect construction was verified via curl;
  the actual Discord round-trip wasn't, no credentials in this environment).
- [x] ~~Port the boards feature (list, create/edit, show, dice roll, tile
  toggle)~~ — done. `BoardController` (index/show/store/update/destroy),
  `PlayerBoardController` (roll/toggleTile, ported from the old
  `PlayersService.rollDice()`/`completeTile()` — SOLO mode only, see below),
  `Pages/Boards/Index.vue`, `Pages/BoardShow.vue`,
  `Components/BoardSettingsModal.vue`. Verified end-to-end in a real
  browser against a fresh SSR build — dice roll and tile toggle both
  confirmed via direct DB state checks (`current_position` and
  `CompletedTile` count changing), not just "no error shown".
  **Known simplifications, not oversights**: co-author management (old
  `EditorsSection.vue`) isn't ported — needs a user-search endpoint that
  doesn't exist yet. TEAM mode (`getOrCreatePlayerBoard`'s shared-PlayerBoard-
  per-team branch) isn't ported — `PlayerBoardController` only handles SOLO.
  Create uses tabs instead of CLAUDE.md's stepper-with-per-step-validation
  convention, to avoid building that plumbing for one form in this pass.
- [x] ~~Rewrite the GraphQL code-first API surface as Inertia controllers~~ —
  done, full rewrite as intended (not a mechanical port; the resolver layer
  has no Laravel equivalent). Boards, teams, tasks, admin, invites, access,
  tiles, leaderboard, profile all have Inertia controllers now.
- [x] ~~Tile editing~~ — done. `TileController::upsert()` (ported from
  `TilesService.upsert()` — a tile is identified by `(board_id, position)`,
  not a pre-existing row; boards were never auto-populated with a full grid
  on creation in the old app either, `GameBoard.vue` rendered
  placeholder "empty-{position}" tiles for any unconfigured position, ported
  the same way here). `TileEditModal.vue` — task search/select (against the
  existing `Task` table, not a live OSRS Wiki call — despite some landing-page
  copy claiming "search the wiki," no such integration exists anywhere in the
  old codebase either, confirmed by grepping for it), tile type, target
  position. `BoardShow.vue` now renders the full grid in boustrophedon
  (snake) order matching real Snakes & Ladders numbering, not a plain
  top-left reading order, and has an edit-mode toggle. Verified via DB:
  assigned a real task to tile 1, confirmed the relation persisted.
- [x] ~~Leaderboard page~~ — done. `LeaderboardController` (ported from
  `PlayersService.getLeaderboard()` — rank, tiles remaining, whether a
  ladder/snake lies on the path ahead), `Boards/Leaderboard.vue`. Found a
  real bug while testing: `PlayerBoard` model had no `team()` relation
  defined at all — a 500 (`Call to undefined relationship [team]`) the
  moment the leaderboard tried to eager-load it. Fixed.
- [x] ~~Profile page~~ — done. `ProfileController` (nickname editing, ported
  from `UsersService.updateProfile()`), `Profile.vue` — role badges, joined
  boards with a progress bar. Verified nickname save via DB.
- [x] ~~Invite management UI~~ — done. An "Invites" tab in
  `BoardSettingsModal.vue` (create/list/revoke), using plain `fetch()`
  against `BoardInviteController` rather than Inertia's router, since the
  modal isn't a page component and an Inertia visit would re-render the
  whole underlying board page just to refresh one list. Uses the
  `XSRF-TOKEN` cookie directly for CSRF (no `<meta name="csrf-token">`
  exists in `app.blade.php` — Blade's `@csrf` is for `<form>` tags, not
  fetch headers). Direct join-by-link route
  (`GET /boards/{board}/join/{token}`, ported from the old
  `join/[token].vue`) redirects unauthenticated visitors through Discord
  login via `redirect()->guest()` + Laravel's own `intended()` mechanism,
  replacing the old client-side `localStorage` post-auth-redirect hack.
  Verified both the create-invite and the join-by-link flows via DB checks.
- [x] ~~Team members modal~~ — done. `TeamMembersModal.vue` — search/add
  (new `TeamController::searchUsers()` endpoint), remove. Verified add and
  remove via DB. Found a real Vue bug while testing: the parent page stored
  `managingTeam` as a direct object reference from the `teams` prop; after
  adding a member triggers an Inertia reload, `teams` gets replaced with
  entirely new objects, but the modal kept displaying the *stale* pre-reload
  team (confirmed live — it showed "No members yet" right after a member had
  actually been added and the underlying page's own list had updated
  correctly). Fixed by storing only the team ID and deriving the current
  team via a computed lookup into the live `teams` prop instead.
- [x] ~~Port teams + admin pages~~ — done. `TeamController`
  (index/store/update/destroy/addMember/removeMember, guild-based visibility
  filter preserved from `TeamsService.findAll()`), `Admin\BoardController`,
  `Admin\TaskController`, `Admin\UserController` (role assign/remove,
  permission grant/revoke — only `canCreateBoards`/`canCreateTiles` exist as
  keys, matching the old `PermissionKey` enum). Verified team creation via
  DB state check in a real browser session, same as the boards mutations.
  **Known simplification**: `TeamController::authorizeManage()` only checks
  `isAdmin() || hasRole('TEAM_MANAGER')` server-side — correct and
  authoritative — but `Teams/Index.vue`'s `canManage` UI flag only checks
  `isAdmin`, since per-team membership role isn't in the shared auth prop.
  A TEAM_MANAGER who isn't admin won't see the manage buttons even though
  the server would allow the action; not a security gap, just a UI gap.
- [x] ~~Port remaining static/marketing pages~~ — done: `Home`, `About`,
  `Donate`, `Privacy`, `Terms`, `OsrsClanEvents`, `OsrsEventIdeas`. Copy
  transcribed from `stale/frontend/locales/en.json` (the real English
  strings, not placeholders) — will need re-extracting into locale files
  once i18n lands, but it's the actual site copy in the meantime, not filler.
  `OsrsClanEvents`' login CTA hit a fifth Ziggy footgun (see #10 below):
  calling `route()` from a `computed()` in `<script setup>` instead of
  directly in the template.
- [x] ~~Pick an i18n solution, verify it's SSR-safe~~ — done.
  `laravel-vue-i18n` (npm package, not a composer one — despite the name it's
  pure Vue/Vite, nothing PHP-side to require). Its own README documents SSR
  needing the *eager* glob variant (`import.meta.glob(..., { eager: true })`)
  in `ssr.js` instead of the Promise-returning one `app.js` uses — this was
  actually verified end-to-end, not just trusted from the docs: a real
  `lang/en.json` test key was curled from raw SSR HTML and the *resolved
  translated string* was present, not the raw key, with zero warnings in the
  SSR log. Wiring is in `vite.config.js` (the `i18n()` plugin), `app.js`, and
  `ssr.js`. `lang/php_*.json` (auto-generated from PHP lang files by the Vite
  plugin, if any get added) is gitignored per the package's own guidance.
- [ ] **Not done**: port the actual 598 keys from
  `stale/frontend/locales/en.json` into `lang/en.json`, and rewire every page
  built so far (15+ files: all of `Boards/`, `Teams/`, `Admin/`, the
  marketing pages, `BoardSettingsModal`/`TaskSettingsModal`/
  `TeamSettingsModal`) from hardcoded English strings to `$t()` calls. This
  is real, large, mechanical work — CLAUDE.md's own model-selection rule
  calls i18n key additions Haiku-tier, distinct from the architecture/
  integration decisions in this file. Nuxt's nested `home.title`-style key
  structure ports directly to `lang/en.json`'s flat JSON format (Laravel's
  JSON translation format uses the literal dotted string as the key, e.g.
  `"home.title": "..."`, not a nested object) — a straight value copy per
  key, not a restructuring.
- [ ] Watch for these SSR gotchas found so far — all fixed once, but easy to
  reintroduce while porting the rest:
  1. Nuxt UI icons render empty in server HTML (fill in after client
     hydration) — fine for Googlebot, invisible to non-JS crawlers/scrapers.
  2. JSON-LD through Inertia's documented `<Head><script v-html>` pattern
     serializes as an `innerHTML="..."` HTML *attribute* during SSR, not the
     tag's text content — invisible to any JSON-LD validator. Route JSON-LD
     through Blade view data instead.
  3. Laravel 11+'s `@context` Blade directive collides with the literal
     `@context` key every JSON-LD block requires, even inside `{!! !!}` raw
     PHP — Blade's directive compiler is a text-level regex with no
     PHP-string awareness. Build JSON-LD strings in the controller, never
     inline in a `.blade.php` file.
  4. Site-name title suffix must live in exactly one place. Setting it in
     both the `createInertiaApp` title callback and a page's own `<title>`
     double-applies on client hydration (SSR output looks fine; the client
     re-templates on top of it).
  5. **The dangerous one**: `<Head>` used only in a `<template>`, never
     referenced in `<script>`, silently fails to auto-import via `@nuxt/ui`'s
     Vite plugin — ships zero meta tags, with a warning that only prints to
     the SSR Node process's own stderr. Nothing in the browser console,
     nothing in a production build. Always `import { Head } from
     '@inertiajs/vue3'` explicitly; don't rely on auto-import for it.
  6. Any `@nuxt/ui` composable reached through `@nuxt/ui/composables`
     (including its own barrel `index.js`, which does `export * from
     './useComponentIcons.js'`) statically imports a virtual `#imports`
     specifier that only resolves through the `ui()` Vite plugin's
     bundler-time pipeline. Vite's SSR build externalizes node_modules deps
     by default, bypassing that pipeline — so importing `useToast` (or
     anything else from that directory) crashed the **entire SSR process at
     startup**, for every page, not just ones that use it. Forcing
     `@nuxt/ui` to bundle instead (`ssr.noExternal`) trades that crash for a
     worse, silent one: every page's SSR output becomes an empty `<div
     id="app">` with no error anywhere, because `@nuxt/ui`'s own BUILD-TIME
     code gets bundled into the runtime and breaks Vue's component
     resolution globally. The real fix: keep anything reaching
     `useComponentIcons.js` (interactive form components —
     u-select/u-switch/u-modal/u-tabs — and any `@nuxt/ui/composables`
     import) out of the SSR module graph entirely, via a `<ClientOnly>`
     wrapper (`resources/js/Components/ClientOnly.vue`) + `defineAsyncComponent`
     for the modal, and a dynamic `import()` inside `onMounted()` for
     `useToast`. Components with zero SEO value when closed/unopened (a
     modal, a toast) cost nothing by skipping SSR — don't fight the bundler
     over them.
  7. Don't name a local variable `page` in a component that also declares a
     `page` **prop**, in the same `<script setup>` scope. `AppRoot.vue`'s
     props include `page` (the Vue component Inertia wants rendered, used in
     the template as `:is="page"`) — adding `const page = usePage()`
     (Inertia's reactive page-STATE object, an unrelated thing with an
     obvious matching name) shadowed the prop. The template's `:is="page"`
     then resolved to the state object instead of the component, and
     silently rendered nothing — the empty-`<div id="app">` symptom above
     had two independent causes, and this one had nothing to do with
     `@nuxt/ui` at all.
  8. Ziggy's `route()` needs its route-definition config explicitly shared
     as an Inertia prop (`'ziggy' => fn () => (new Ziggy)->toArray()` in
     `HandleInertiaRequests`) for SSR to work. The `@routes` Blade directive
     only writes a `<script>` tag for the *browser's* `window.Ziggy` — the
     Node SSR process never sees it, so calling `route()` from any
     server-rendered page throws `Cannot read properties of undefined
     (reading 'login')` deep inside `ziggy-js`, crashing that page's entire
     render. (Note the correct import is `Tighten\Ziggy\Ziggy` —
     `tightenco/ziggy`'s composer package name doesn't match its own PHP
     namespace.)
  9. `route()` (Ziggy) is only bound on Vue's `globalProperties` by the
     `ZiggyVue` plugin — usable as a bare identifier directly in a
     `<template>`, but not from plain `<script setup>` JS (a `computed()`
     callback, a function body). `import { route } from 'ziggy-js'` looks
     like the fix but isn't: that named export resolves its OWN Ziggy config
     independently of the plugin instance `ssr.js` explicitly configured
     with `page.props.ziggy`, falling back to a global `Ziggy` variable that
     doesn't exist in Node — reintroducing the exact SSR crash bug #8 fixed,
     just scoped to whichever page's script calls it. Keep every `route()`
     call directly in the template; restructure the component (extra
     `v-if`/`v-else` branches, whatever it takes) rather than hoisting the
     call into script.
  10. Cast every `datetime`-shaped column on every model, even ones that look
     obviously date-like. `PlayerBoard::$casts` didn't include
     `last_roll_date`, so `Auth`-flow-verified, curl-verified SSR output
     looked completely correct right up until the dice-roll button was
     actually clicked in a real browser — `$playerBoard->last_roll_date
     ?->isToday()` threw `Call to a member function isToday() on string`,
     a 500 with zero SSR/Vue involvement at all. A reminder that curling SSR
     HTML only proves the *read* path works — mutations need their own
     end-to-end check, ideally by verifying the actual DB row changed, not
     just that the request returned 200.
  11. Define every relation a controller will eager-load, even obvious ones.
     `PlayerBoard` had `user()`/`board()`/`completedTiles()` but no `team()`
     — invisible until `LeaderboardController` tried `->with(['user',
     'team'])` and got `RelationNotFoundException`. Same lesson as #10: this
     had nothing to do with SSR or Vue, a plain Eloquent gap that curling a
     *different* page's SSR output would never have caught.
  12. Not a bug — a testing-methodology trap worth recording anyway, since it
     burned real time: Reka UI's `Tabs` (underneath `@nuxt/ui`'s `u-tabs`)
     requires the tab trigger to actually hold DOM focus
     (`document.activeElement`) before it registers a click. A synthetic
     `el.click()` — even a full `pointerdown`/`mousedown`/`pointerup`/
     `mouseup`/`click` event sequence — silently no-ops without `el.focus()`
     first. Looked exactly like an app bug (tabs appearing to not switch at
     all) until `el.focus(); el.click()` fixed it instantly. When a browser
     tool test shows an interactive element doing nothing, try focusing it
     explicitly before concluding the app itself is broken.
  13. Don't make a list passed to `u-tabs`' `:items` a `computed()` if it can
     be static. Chased gotcha #12 above down the wrong path first: reactive
     `tabs` depending on other component state seemed like the natural
     explanation for tabs "not switching," since a new array reference on
     every render is a real Reka UI reset trigger in general — it just
     wasn't the actual cause here. Left as a static array with content-level
     `v-if` gating instead, which sidesteps the question rather than
     resolving it either way.
- [ ] `stale/` can be deleted once the migration is verified complete and the
  team is confident nothing needs porting from it anymore.

## Admin & users (step 3)

- [ ] Design what "admin functionality" beyond board CRUD actually needs to
  cover — this wasn't scoped yet, needs a real requirements pass before
  building.
- [ ] User management beyond Discord OAuth: currently the *only* way into
  the app is Discord login. Decide whether that stays the sole auth path or
  whether an internal/admin account type is needed (e.g. for support access
  without a Discord account).
- [ ] Filament was evaluated as a CMS candidate for Phase 6 (marketing/landing
  copy editing). Verdict from the prototype: it solves the authoring UI
  (its `Builder` field + `spatie/laravel-permission`), not the rendering
  half — the public Vue/Inertia site still needs a hand-built block
  renderer either way. Worth prototyping as a **narrow standalone service**
  (its own small Filament app, same Postgres DB, consumed by the existing
  frontend) rather than pulled in as part of the full migration.

## Security (step 4)

- [x] ~~BoardAccessMode (OPEN/GUILD/INVITE) enforcement~~ — done.
  `App\Services\BoardAccessService` (ported from the old
  `AccessService`/`InvitesService`): `hasAccess()`/`canJoin()`/`joinBoard()`/
  `useInvite()`, same rules as before — board authors always pass, OPEN
  always passes, GUILD checks `UserGuild`, INVITE requires a token/code and
  consumes it in a transaction that increments `BoardInvite.use_count`
  (confirmed via DB check, not just a 200 response). `BoardController::show()`
  now actually calls `hasAccess()` and renders `Boards/AccessGate.vue`
  instead of the board for anyone who fails it; `PlayerBoardController`'s
  roll/toggle actions check it too, not just `auth` middleware.
  `BoardInviteController` (create/revoke, owner-or-admin gated) exists but
  has no UI yet — invites can only be created via tinker/an API client, not
  from the board settings modal. New routes: `POST /boards/{board}/join`,
  `POST /boards/{board}/invites`, `DELETE /boards/{board}/invites/{invite}`.
  **Found and fixed while testing this**: `BoardShow.vue`'s Roll/tile
  buttons were gated on `playerBoard` already existing, but `playerBoard`
  is only ever *created* by rolling/toggling — a genuine cold-start deadlock
  where a brand-new player could never start playing at all. Every earlier
  test of this page used the seeder's pre-created `PlayerBoard` row and
  never exercised a first-time visit, so it went unnoticed until testing the
  INVITE join flow with a fresh user in a real browser. Invite-management UI
  is now built too — see Migration above.
- [ ] Rate limiting / throttling on the Discord OAuth routes.
- [ ] CSRF, session, and cookie config review once real deployment domains
  are known (currently defaults from a fresh `laravel/laravel` scaffold).
